Send notifications to Slack channels when certain events in WordPress occur.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to send notifications to [Slack](https://slack.com) channels when certain events in WordPress occur.

By default, there are two events that can be sent to Slack:

1. When a post needs review (status transitioned to 'pending')
1. When a post is published
1. When there's a new comment

It's possible to add more events using `slack_get_events` filter. For more information check [the doc](http://gedex.web.id/wp-slack/).

**Development of this plugin is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/gedex/wp-slack). Pull requests are always welcome**.

There are some extension plugins that notify events triggered by other plugins. Belows are some of them:

* [Slack EDD](http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-edd)
* [Slack WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-woocommerce)
* [Slack Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-contact-form-7)
* [Slack Gravity Forms](http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-gravityforms)
* [Slack User Password Reset](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-password-reset-notifications-for-slack/)
